# Atmospheric, Climate, and Weather Data Tools

Software for automated data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualization.

## Projects

The following projects were **designed, written, and tested entirely by a human author, without the use of AI coding agents or automated code-generation systems**:

- **Arotake**  
  Provides a command-line tool and an API that automate evaluating NOAA High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) forecasts against Local Climatological Data version 2 (LCD v2) observations.
  
- **hrrr-data**  
  Provides a command-line tool and an API that automate accessing, downloading, and processing NOAA High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) forecast data from NOAA’s public AWS S3 bucket.

- **lcd-v2-data**  
  Provides a command-line tool and an API that automate downloading NOAA Local Climatological Data version 2 (LCD v2) observations for a selected US state/territory/RTO-ISO region and converts them to full-hourly UTC time series.

- **isd-lite-data**  
  Provides a command-line tool and an API that that automate downloading NOAA Integrated Surface Database Lite (ISD-Lite) for a selected US state/territory/RTO-ISO region.
