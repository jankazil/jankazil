# Atmospheric, Climate, and Weather Data Tools

Software for automated data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualization.

## Projects

The following projects were **designed, written, and tested entirely by a human author, without the use of AI coding agents or automated code-generation systems**:

- **Arotake**  
  Provides a command-line tool and an application programming interface (API) that automate evaluating
  - NOAA High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) surface forecasts
  
  against observational time series:
  
  - Local Climatological Data version 2 (LCD v2)
  - Integrated Surface Database Lite (ISD-Lite)
  
- **hrrr-data**  
  Provides a command-line tool and an API that automate accessing, downloading, and processing NOAA High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) forecast data from NOAA’s public AWS S3 bucket.

- **lcd-v2-data**  
  Provides a command-line tool and an API that automate downloading, filtering, and processing NOAA Local Climatological Data version 2 (LCD v2) observations for
  
  - selected U.S. states and territories,
  - Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) and Independent System Operator (ISO) regions.
  
  The original time series are converted from their irregularly spaced, local time to full-hour UTC time.

- **isd-lite-data**  
  Provides a command-line tool and an API that automate downloading, filtering, and processing NOAA Integrated Surface Database Lite (ISD-Lite) observations for
  
  - selected countries,
  - U.S. states and territories,
  - Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) and Independent System Operator (ISO) regions.
